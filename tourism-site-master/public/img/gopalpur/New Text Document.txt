Astaranga Beach is another popular beach resort near Puri. The beach offers an enchanting view of the horizon which becomes uncommonly colourful during sunset. In fact, the name Astaranga is a combination of two Odia words—asta (sunset) and ranga (colourful)—and this is why it’s also called a photographer's delight. The beach is also a popular fishing destination for Puri district. A small fishing market operates on the beach every morning, where fishermen immediately sell their catch to vendors. There is a shrine of Pir Jahania near the long, sandy beach, which is frequented by both Hindus and Muslims. They come to take the blessings of Pir Jahania and offer a chadar. Apart from the magnificent sea view, visitors can watch the nesting of Olive Ridley turtles during winter. There’s also a mangrove path near the mouth of the Devi River. Although a beautiful beach, many areas are muddy or have quicksand and visitors need to take guides when venturing into unexplored areas on the beach. There are no accommodation options near the beach and the travellers need to put up at Puri, Konark or Bhubaneswar. By road, the Astaranga Beach is 90 km from Puri and 19 km from Konark. It is also well-connected to Bhubaneswar.
